## How to use it

- Install the requirements

```bash
poetry install
```

- Add your OpenAI API key to the `config.yaml` file (or set it as an environment variable)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

- To summarize the video, run:

```bash
python tldw.py summarize "[VIDEO_URL]"
```

- To get the video transcription, run:

```bash
python tldw.py transcribe "[VIDEO_URL]"
```

## Caveats

- You will need to authenticate with your google account in the first run so `pytube` can download the video
- We use the [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) library to transcribe the audio, which uses `ffmpeg`. Refer to
  the [installation instructions](https://github.com/openai/whisper#setup) to install it.
- The transcription is not perfect, but it's a good start. If things are not good enough, try picking a different
  whisper model in `config.yaml`.
- The summarization is not perfect either. If things are not good enough, try picking a different temperature - or tweak
  the prompt at `yt_summarizer/base.py`.
